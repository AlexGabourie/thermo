Thermodynamic Molecular Dynamics
===========================================

The thermodynamic Molecular Dynamics, or `thermoMD`_, package is a set of `Python`_  tools to interface with the molecular dynamics (MD) simulators `GPUMD`_ and `LAMMPS`_ for the purpose of thermodynamic simulations (i.e. thermal conductivity).

Currently, the functionality is limited as it serves specific research purposes at this time; however, the long-term plan is to make this package to primarily serve `GPUMD`_ with only minor supporting functions for `LAMMPS`_ for the purpose of checking force-consistency between the simulators.

The documenation is produced and maintained by `Alex Gabourie <https://github.com/AlexGabourie>`_ at Stanford University. It outlines the structure and usage of the `thermoMD`_ package.
