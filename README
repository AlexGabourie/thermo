Installation Notes:

Use the following command:

pip install git+ssh://git@bitbucket.org/Gabory47/thermo.git

This should install all of the dependencies and the thermo package in the virtual environment.


Old Installation Notes:

To get this module to work, I had to put a symbolic link in the following folder:
/home/alex/eclipse_workspace/custom_lammps/cl/lib/python2.7/site-packages

with the command:
ln -s /home/alex/eclipse_workspace/custom_lammps/thermo/ .

This works with the current virtual env. If this package gets really large, perhaps it would be 
better to do this the correct way.
