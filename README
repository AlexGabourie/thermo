To get this module to work, I had to put a symbolic link in the following folder:
/home/alex/eclipse_workspace/custom_lammps/cl/lib/python2.7/site-packages

with the command:
ln -s /home/alex/eclipse_workspace/custom_lammps/thermo/ .

This works with the current virtual env. If this package gets really large, perhaps it would be 
better to do this the correct way.
